# DiagnoBot 🧰

> Revolutionizing healthcare triage and diagnostics using AI.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Healthcare systems are frequently overwhelmed, especially during emergencies or peak hours. This often leads to:

* Long wait times for non-critical cases
* Delayed attention for urgent cases
* Manual bottlenecks in appointment management and diagnosis

### We asked ourselves:

> "What if AI could assist in determining patient urgency, suggest first-line care, and help route them to the right doctor immediately?"

* Patient triage
* Preliminary diagnosis
* Instant care suggestions
